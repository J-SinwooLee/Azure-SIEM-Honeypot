# Microsoft Sentinel SIEM Wrold Map Project

<hr>
<h3>Overview</h3>
In this project, I'll illustrate the process of configuring Azure services and demonstrate their application in setting up a honeypot. By creating this environment, we can observe and analyze attacker activity as they attempt to access our virtual machine. At the end of the project, we will create a map using Microsft Sentinel to overview where the attackers were coming from as well as how many attacks were attempted. Additionally, we'll utilize Microsoft Sentinel to generate a map, providing insights into the origins of the attacks and the frequency of attempted breaches. This project was inspired by Josh Madakor's SIEM guide, and all credit goes to him.
